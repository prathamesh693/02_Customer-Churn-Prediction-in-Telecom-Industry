# Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage patterns, account information, and customer service interactions.

## Objective

- Build accurate predictive models to identify customers at risk of churn.  
- Enable proactive retention strategies to reduce churn rate.  
- Provide insights into key factors driving customer churn.

## Challenges

- Imbalanced data: Churners often represent a minority class, making model training more difficult.  
- Data quality: Missing or inconsistent values may affect model performance.  
- Feature selection and engineering: Identifying the most relevant variables to improve predictions.  
- Generalization: Ensuring the model performs well on unseen data, not just training data.  
- Interpretability: Explaining model decisions to business stakeholders for actionable insights.
