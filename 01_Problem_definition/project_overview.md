# Project Overview

This project aims to build and deploy a predictive model for telecom customer churn using various machine learning algorithms including Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model helps telecom operators identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling targeted marketing and customer retention campaigns.

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Data Collection:** Acquire raw telecom customer data from reliable sources.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, encode, and transform data for modeling.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand data distributions, relationships, and key factors influencing churn.  
4. **Model Development:** Train and tune multiple models (Decision Tree, XGBoost, SVM) to predict churn.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Compare models using classification metrics and select the best-performing one.  
6. **Model Deployment:** Save the trained model and build a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.  
7. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Track model performance over time and update as needed.
